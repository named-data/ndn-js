NDN-JS: A javascript client library for Named Data Networking
-------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC LIBRARY: NO BUILD REQUIRED
================================
The basic NDN-JS library does not need to be "built".  For the library, you can manually
include the necessary scripts in a web page or include build/ndn.js to have it load all of
the scripts.

BUILD A COMBINED, COMPRESSED LIBRARY 
====================================

While the combined file ndn.js is useful for debugging, a more efficient way to include the library 
is to used the combined, compressed library build/ndn.min.js.
While we try to keep a built version in that directory for convenience, it
may fall out of sync with the library, so we recommend building it as follows if possible.

To create a combined and compressed versions of NDN-JS scripts:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf

These commands will create a combined version build/ndn.js, and combined version build/ndn.min.js, compressed 
using  Google's Closure Compiler.

The compressed version is what we recommend including in applications.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
The documentation is auto-generated using JSDoc.  If you don't have JSDoc installed, download and unzip from:
https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/archive/master.zip

To make doc, cd to the root directory of ndn-js and run the following command to put the output in subdirectory doc:
<path-to-jsdoc>/jsdoc --recurse --destination doc js README.md

WEBSOCKETS PROXY
================

If you wish to run your own WebSockets proxy instead of using the NDN testbed, you must
build and install Node.js (often on the machine also running the ndnd you wish to proxy
for, but that doesn't have to be the case).  See wsproxy/README.md

THE FIREFOX ADD-ON
==================

First build the compressed version of NDN.js

    ./waf configure
    ./waf

Then go to the ndn-protocol directory and run ./make-ndn-protocol.sh which makes ndn-protocol.xpi in the top directory.
