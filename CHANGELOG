NDN-JS v0.3 (2014-02-27)
------------------------

This release uses NDN-TLV for the default wire format.

Changes
* You should use get/setKeyLocator in the Signature object instead of locator in the Data signedInfo.
* Added get/setKeyLocator in the Signature object.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1073 In Face.expressInterest, support onData and onTimeout callbacks.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1087 In Name.getPrefix, support a negative argument, e.g. getPrefix(-1).
* In Face.registerPrefix, add support for onInterest and onRegisterFailed callbacks and ForwardingFlags.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1084 Internal: Binary XML decoding speed up to only support DTags.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1121 In Name.get, allow a negative index.
* In Name, added method getSubName.
* Added utility classes Blob and SignedBlob.
* In WireFormat, added getDefaultWireFormat and setDefaultWireFormat.
* In Data, added wireEncode (which returns a SignedBlob) and wireDecode.
* In Interest, added  wireEncode (which returns a Blob) and wireDecode.
* Added class MetaInfo and deprecated SignedInfo.
* Moved classes Exclude, Signature, MetaInfo and KeyLocator into their own source files.
* In Interest, added get/setKeyLocator.
* In Interest, added get/setMustBeFresh.
* In KeyLocatorType, added KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST.
* In MetaInfo (formerly SignedInfo) setFields, set a KeyLocatorType.KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST instead of a KEY.
* In EncodingUtils.decodeHexData, etc., added an optional wireFormat argument.

Deprecated
* SignedInfo (MetaInfo): Deprecated the locator. You should use get/setKeyLocator in the Signature object.
* Interest: Deprecated getAnswerOriginKind.  Use getMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated setAnswerOriginKind.  Use setMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the interest has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type KeyLocatorType.KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* SignedInfo: Deprecated class SignedInfo. Use MetaInfo.
* Face/NDN: Deprecated expressInterest(name, closure [, template]). You should use 
  expressInterest which uses callbacks, not Closure.
* Face/NDN: Deprecated registerPrefix(name, closure [, intFlags]). You should use 
  registerPrefix which uses callbacks, not Closure.
* Data: Deprecated encode and decode.  You should use wireEncode (which returns a SignedBlob) and wireDecode.
* Interest: Deprecated encode and decode.  You should use wireEncode (which returns a Blob) and wireDecode.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1303 Call all callbacks where the interest matches the incoming data packet.

Documentation
* wsproxy: In the README, document option -n for the remote ndnd port.

NDN-JS v0.2 (2013-11-08)
------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1060 Rename the combined files ndn-js.js and ndn-js.min.js to ndn.js and ndn.min.js.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1048 Add support for Node.js to merge with NDN-On-Node.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1071 Renamed the main NDN class to Face.
* Updated the main Face object to use a TcpTransport by default for Node.js.
* Change all code to use new Buffer instead of new Uint8Array.
* Moved global LOG variable to file Log.js.  If you want to change the log level, change Log.LOG .
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1051 If a host is specified, the Face constructor defaults to port 6363 instead of port 9695.
* Added Name.Component class and changed Name to use it. Name.getComponent still returns the component value but is deprecated.
* Added Name.get which returns a Name.Component (not the component byte array).
* Added Name.size. Deprecated Name.getComponentCount.
* Change Exclude to hold Name.Component instead of Buffer. The Exclude constructor accepts an array of Name.Component or Buffer.
* Renamed ContentObject class to Data.  In the UpcallInfo object, renamed contentObject to data.
* EncodingUtils: Added encodeToHexData, decodeHexData and dataToHtml.
* Moved files in tests/ to tests/browser/ .
* Added test files from NDN-On-Node to tests/node/ . 
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1052 wsproxy: Added -n command line option to set the ndnd port.
* In EncodingUtils.js, made all functions static members of EncodingUtils.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1038 Default to not verify data packets until crypto API is updated.
* Added NameEnumeration support and a test in tests/browser/test-name-enumeration.html.
* Updated security library to use 'RSA-Sign JavaScript Library' and 'crypto.js'.
* Removed unsupported Witness.js (Merkle trees). Rename Signature.Witness to witness (lower case) and it is just a Buffer.
* Removed unimplemented TextXML encoder, especially since we will move away from XML wire formats.
* Internally changed "ccn" to "ndn" in function names and comments.
* Added Interest.toUri().
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1059 Changed file names to lower case. Applications include build/ndn.js, so are unaffected.
* Firefox add-on: Support NDNFS: If the returned data name has %C1.FS.file, remove it and request the actual file.

* ndnProtocol.xpi. Use ndn-protocol.xpi which is the new name of the Firefox add-on file.
* NDN: This class is deprecated. Use Face.
* ContentObject: This class is deprecated. Use Data.
* Name: Deprecated getComponent.  Use get(i).getValue().
* Name: Deprecated getComponentCount.  Use size().
* Name: Deprecated to_uri.  Use toUri.
* Name: Deprecated getName.  Use toUri.
* Name: Deprecated add and addSegment.  Use append and appendSegment.
* Name: Deprecated equalsName.  Use equals.
* Name: Deprecated matches_name.  Use matchesName.
* EncodingUtils.js: Deprecated using the global functions.  Use static members of EncodingUtils class.
* EncodingUtils.js: Deprecated encodeToBinaryInterest. Use interest.encode().
* EncodingUtils.js: Deprecated encodeToBinaryContentObject. Use data.encode().
* EncodingUtils.js: Deprecated encodeToHexContentObject. Use EncodingUtils.encodeToHexData.
