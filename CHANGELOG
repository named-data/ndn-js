--------------------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1048 Add support for Node.js to merge with NDN-On-Node.
* Updated the main NDN object to use a TcpTransport by default for Node.js.
* Change all code to use new Buffer instead of new Uint8Array.
* Moved global LOG variable to file Log.js.  If you want to change the log level, change Log.LOG .
* Moved files in tests/ to tests/browser/ .
* Added test files from NDN-On-Node to tests/node/ . 
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1051 If a host is specified, the NDN constructor defaults to port 6363 instead of port 9695.
* In EncodingUtils.js, made all functions static members of EncodingUtils.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1038 Default to not verify data packets until crypto API is updated.
* Added NameEnumeration support and a test in tests/browser/test-name-enumeration.html.
* Updated security library to use 'RSA-Sign JavaScript Library' and 'crypto.js'.
* Removed unsupported Witness.js (Merkle trees). Rename Signature.Witness to witness (lower case) and it is just a Buffer.
* Removed unimplemented TextXML encoder, especially since we will move away from XML wire formats.
* Internally changed "ccn" to "ndn" in function names and comments.
