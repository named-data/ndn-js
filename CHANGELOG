     Signature object get/setKeyLocator().
* Removed deprecated NDNx classes ForwardingEntry, FaceInstance, KeyManager,
  NameEnumeration, ExponentialReExpressClosure, Closure, KeyName, KeyNameType,
  PublisherID, PublisherType, NDNTime, SignedInfo (use MetaInfo),
  Signature (use Sha256WithRsaSignature), ContentObject (use Data) and NDN (use Face).
* Removed deprecated NDNx BinaryXmlWireFormat and support for binary XML packets.
* In WireFormat, removed ENABLE_NDNX since all NDNx support is now removed.

NDN-JS v0.8.1 (2015-05-14)
--------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2624 By default, throw an exception when
  using the deprecated NDNx and binary XML wire format, or when using NDNx-style
  key management with globalKeyManager and the Key class. To enable support while
  you upgrade your code to use NFD, in your main application set
  WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX = true
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2388 Moved example programs from "tests" to "examples".
* Browser support for crypto.subtle native speedups, automatically used for verify and
  KeyChain.sign (if using the onComplete callback). Tested in Chrome and Firefox.
  Thanks to Ryan Bennett!
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1921 In Face, added getMaxNdnPacketSize().
  expressInterest throws an exception if the encoded interest size exceeds it.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2566 In Face, added setInterestFilter. In
  registerPrefix, make the onInterest callback optional.
* Face: In registerPrefix, changed the onInterest callback to pass interestFilterId
  instead of registeredPrefixId.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2579 In registerPrefix and setInterestFilter,
  support the onInterest callback form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter).
  The new callback form is passed the Face instead of Transport so that you can
  supply the Data with face.putData(). It also takes the InterestFilter supplied
  to setInterestFilter.
* MemoryContentCache: In registerPrefix, changed the onDataNotFound callback to call
  onDataNotFound(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter).
  If your application uses onDataNotFound, you must update your callback function.
* Implemented FilePrivateKeyStorage for Node.js. Thanks to Andrew Brown!
* In ControlParameters, added support for Uri and Strategy. Allow the Name to be optional. Thanks to Andrew Brown!
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2532#change-8836 In Face.registerPrefix,
  if connected to a remote NFD then use localhop to do remote registration. (For
  remote registration, the remote NFD must be configured for localhop_security.)
  Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local.
* In the default WireFormat, implemented decodeControlParameters. Thanks again to Andrew Brown!
* In Interest setter methods, return this so that you can chain calls to update values.
* Added class util/SegmentFetcher, ported from ndn-cxx. Use it in examples/node/test-list-rib, etc.
* examples: Added test-list-channels, test-list-faces, test-list-rib and
  test-register-route to query NFD.
* In MemoryContentCache, added support for storePendingInterest. add(data) will
  check if the added Data packet satisfies any pending interest. You can use
  getStorePendingInterest() for onDataNotFound in registerPrefix().
* examples: In ndnping/ndn-ping.js, changed to use onData instead of a deprecated Closure.
* examples: In node/repo-ng added basic-insertion.js and watched-insertion.js and
  in browser/repo-ng added basic-insertion.html and watched-insertion.html to
  show interaction with the repo-ng repository.
* examples: In browser, removed the old-style test-publish-async.html and added
  test-publish-async-nfd.html and test-echo-consumer.html, similar to Node.js.
* examples: Removed browser/test-encode-decode-interest-with-forwarding-entry and
  node/test-publish-async-ndnx because NDNx support is deprecated.
* Moved tests which need NFD from tests/unit_tests to tests/integration_tests.
* Unit tests: Added test-der-encode-decode tests for CertificateExtension.
* Unit tests: In test-interest-methods, added ExcludeMatches.
* Integration tests: Added test-file-private-key-storage. Thanks to Andrew Brown!

Deprecated
* Deprecated support for NDNx and binary XML. See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Data, deprecated sign/verify. Use KeyChain sign/verifyData. See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In MetaInfo, deprecated setFields. Use KeyChain sign/verifyData. See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* Deprecated Key, globalKeyManager and security/KeyManager. Use KeyChain sign/verifyData.
  See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Face, deprecated NDNx-style verification in Closure.upcall. Use KeyChain.verifyData.
  See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Face, deprecated registerPrefix where the onInterest callback has the form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, transport, interestFilterId). Use the
  registerPrefix where onInterest has the form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter) so you can call
  face.putData().

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2001 Change the Face pending interest table,
  etc. from static to member variables of each face.
* In ProtobufTlv.encode (in Node.js), instead of toBinary() to convert a binary
  value, use toBuffer() to produce a Node.js Buffer.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2758 ControlParameters with empty name not properly encoded.

  these changes cause unexpected behavior in your application, you can revert
  to NDN-JS version v0.4 while updating your application.
  - Changed Name.Component.getValue() to return a Blob, not Buffer. If you need the

    former behavior, call the deprecated method getKeyDataAsBuffer().

* In Name.Component, added toSegment and toVersion.
* In Name.appendSegment and appendVersion, encode the number as nonNegativeInteger which is always 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
  This means that appendSegment(0) now encodes as %00%00 instead of just %00.
* In Name, added appendSegmentOffset, appendTimestamp and appendSequenceNumber.
* In Name.Component, added toSegmentOffset, toTimestamp and toSequenceNumber.
* In Face.expressInterest, return the pendingInterestId. Added Face.removePendingInterest.

NDN-JS v0.1 (2013-08-06)
------------------------

This is the initial release, compatible with the API in use for about the past year.
The API will change soon for v0.2 .
